# fren
A Rust TUI tool like spf or yazi

It demark itself with a open feature letting you open files, directory with any app and being lighter

if you want to build it you can always clone it and cd to the dir and use makepkg -si

apparently i am too dumb to make it an aur package but if anybody want to take its time with me and explain it i will do it xd

have a nice day
